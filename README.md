### Wireframes

Wireframes were developed at the outset of the project to visualize the site's layout and prioritise mobile-first design. These wireframes ensured that content would be accessible and optimized across all screen sizes, providing a seamless experience for visitors on any device.

Each wireframe link presents mock-ups for the corresponding pages, showcasing their appearance on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Deployment

#### Prerequisites
* Heroku Account: Ensure you have an active Heroku account. You can sign up at Heroku.
* Heroku CLI: Install the Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine. Instructions for installation can be found here.
* Git: Ensure Git is installed and configured on your local machine. Instructions for installation can be found here.
* PostgreSQL Database: The application uses a PostgreSQL database. You can use Heroku's PostgreSQL add-on or an external provider like Neon.

#### Steps to Deploy

1. Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/klchambers/pp5ecommerce.git`

`cd pp5ecommerce`

2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

`python -m venv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`, or on Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create an env.py file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

`import os`

`os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', <your_database_url>)`

`os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', <your_database_url>)`

(note: Add .env.py/env.py to .gitignore and save before pushing your code to Github. This will prevent sensitive information from being made publicly available)

In the project's settings.py file, import your database URL and secret key:

`if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
    import env`

`SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')`

Add `.herokuapp.com` to ALLOWED_HOSTS

4. Prepare Static Assets

`python manage.py collectstatic`

5. Initialize a Git Repository

`git init`

`git add .`

`git commit -m "Initial commit"`

6. Create a Heroku App

`heroku create <'your app name'>`

7. Deploy to Heroku

`git push heroku main`

8. Apply DB migrations

`python3 manage.py makemigrations`

`python3 manage.py migrate`

9. Create a Superuser

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

Follow the instructions in your terminal to create your superuser account username and passwords

10. Open the application

`heroku open`
